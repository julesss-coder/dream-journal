VERSION 2
- getting an overview of the type and frequency of their dream topics, dream types. 
  Example: tag cloud with the bigger tags being the more frequently dreamed topics. Later versions: Network map, or other diagrams.
  On tag click: display all dreams containing this tag

- It should be password-protected.

IDEAS FOR LATER VERSIONS 
- other types of data visualizations:
  - timeline, so that user can see development of dreams over time and correlate them to events in their life; add notes to dream at a later date, if dream proved prophetic
  - network graph, to show which topics are connected (like in Obsidian)
-App *must* be possible to navigate with keyboard instead of mouse



GENERAL
- Target user: Someone who is interested in analyzing their dreams and really keeps accounts of them. They will most likely not use this website on waking up, but just jot down a few words on paper when waking up. Then, later, the prompts in the web app and their own notes will help them remember the dream. They will also write down thoughts about the dream. the main goal is to see if they can draw inspiration and insight from their dreams, and by analyzing their frequency and type, find out things about themselves. Improving dream recall is not the goal, although writing down all details remembered about the dream may contribute to that. However, it is assumed that the user already takes written notes on their dreams elsewhere.
